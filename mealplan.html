    <h1 class="h" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">How to integrate dieting in your daily life?</h1>

    <h2 class="h">Should you have a diet?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px !important;"> Following a healthy diet is probably something we all wish we would do, but never get to it and even when we do - we tend to fail quite often. Why is that the case? Why even in the best cases when people manage to go throught their planned 90 days of eating healthy they end up gaining the lost weight back. Sometimes gaining even more than they lost through their hard work. While there are many studies on this subject one particular reason seems to be fairly common.</p>
    
    <h2 class="h">Strict diet</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px !important;"> People go too hard with restrictions. While taking out all the sweets and all the junk food can work out in the short term if you do not allow yourself a cheat day from time to time, sustaining the diet becomes extremely difficult. Fairly commonly the diet breaks appart after one moment of weakness where they give in for something they forbade themselves from eating. This causes a lot of disstress for us, making us feel inadequate, even worthless. It is very easy to get overwhelmed by such thoughts and to quit the diet altogether.</p>

    <h2 class="h">Balancing diet</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px !important;"> This is why I believe in a balanced diet. A diet where you allow yourself to be a little bit more loose with the foods that you consume, while still making sure that the majority is composed of healthy foods. Even though you may lose less weight in the short run, this kind of a diet is much more sustainable and makes it easier to stick to it. However, when it comes to what kind of diet you should choose no expert can really help you out too much. Figuring out what kind of diet suits you takes a lot of trial and error, which only you can do.</p>

    <h2 class="h">Calories, working out and diets</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px !important;"> It is commonly heard that 90% of working out is done in the kitchen and while that has some truth to it, people can go way overboard with it. While this subject is much more complex in the end wether you gain or lose weight all comes downs to how many calories you take in and how many calories you use up through the day. If you want to lose weight it is recomended not to go any lower than 500 kcal than your daily energy expenditure and as for gaining weight it varies a bit more, but consistantly eating 200-300 kcal more than your TDEE will get the job done.</p>

    <h2 class="h">Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure </h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px !important;"> Total Daily Energy Expenditure is comprised of Basal metabolic rate (BMR), thermic effect of feeding (TEF), exercise energy expenditure (EEE) and non-excercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT). Keep in mind that the following formula is a rough estimate, since every human's body is different. </p>
  </div>


<div class="container-calculator">
  <p style="font-size:20px !important; text-align: center;"> TDEE = BMR + TEF + EEE + NEAT = weight(kg) * 20 + weight(kg) * 2 + (250(for low intensity 1 hour workout) / 500(for high intensity 1 hour workout) + (250(sitting job) / 500(job that involves physical activity)</p>

  <h2 class="h">Supplements</h2>
  <p style="font-size:20px !important;"> It can be quite tempting to go out and buy all kinds of supplements. Commercials can make them look like a life saving pill which will do all the work for you. Well it won't. However, can it help you achieve your goals faster if you put in the work yourself? Yes, most definitely it can, but you need to be careful about what kind of supplements you choose. Consistantly consuming questionable quality chemical powders can have a negative long-term effect on you. Which is why I would recommend to not be cheap when buying supplements and choose decent quality ones. As for which specific ones I feel are worth taking? Protein - it can be hard to consume the required amount of protein through foods alone, creatine and caffeine. Multivitamins are also fine if you have a vitamin deficiency (keep in mind that if you do not - consuming more will not benefit you) </p>
